# General-Python-Stuff



I thought I uploaded this a month ago but apparently I didn't. General Python stuff, basically all of it is unrelated but I put it in the same place just because I wanted to.

This stuff is mostly completed but mostly uncommented. I also have a bunch of other stuff I plan on uploading, but I need to figure out what is or isn't in any way complete. A lot of it consists of programs I tried to write but they didn't work, and then tried again 3 more times and those all didn't work either. I will eventually clean some of them up though.
